# Overview
Are you excited about constructing an **exemplary portfolio website** to display your professional achievements and experiences, but hitting roadblocks along the way? Let's list some common issues:

1. Are you an adept programmer but not well-versed in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript?
2. Have you recently ventured into coding, but still lack the knowledge to create a standout website?
3. Do you find it challenging to develop impressive design materials for your site?
4. Is programming a new field for you, and you're looking to expedite your learning through AI-powered tools like ChatGPT?

Well, this tutorial is here to help! By leveraging **GPT-4**, **Midjourney**, and **Leonardo.AI**, you can surmount these obstacles. However, be aware this guide won't provide an exhaustive, detailed breakdown of every aspect of portfolio website development. Instead, our objective is to show how to reduce the load of both design and coding by leveraging the power of AI.

Additionally, we'll be demonstrating a demo project constructed on the basis of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Typescript. Although these libraries aren't the main focus, their contribution is significant in bolstering our programming work and enhancing GPT-4's output.

Our video tutorial begins with an introduction, followed by a tour of the final product - the website you're currently visiting. First, we'll dive into utilizing Midjourney to fabricate unique, imaginative portfolio designs. Next, we'll explore prompting Midjourney to generate a distinctive logo for your personal brand. Once we've created a compelling logo, we'll delve into using Leonardo.AI to construct visually stunning portraits. Finally, we arrive at the ChatGPT segment, where we'll employ GPT-4 to handle various elements of portfolio websites, including navigation bars, hero sections, article preview, animations, mobile-first responsive design, scroll progress bars, back-to-top buttons, and more."

I hope this tutorial provides the insights and inspiration you need to create your own outstanding portfolio website!
